# jwt-tokens
JWT Tokens is a small repository of JSON web token based utilities that I have created to use in various independent projects. These utilities are bare-bones but tests are included.

### Install
Just clone/copy/download the repo to get the files and run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.

### Tests
The `package.json` file has a test script defined, so just run `npm test` once all of the packages are installed. See [Majestic](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic) for a great GUI for the Jest tests.
